# i18next MCP Server Diagnosis Report

## Issue Summary

The i18next MCP server package was failing when executed via `npx` with the error:
```
sh: línia 1: i18next-mcp-server: no s'ha trobat l'ordre
```
(Translation: "command not found")

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Package Installation Issue**
- The published package (`i18next-mcp-server@1.0.1`) was not being recognized as an executable command when run via `npx`
- This suggests that npm was not properly setting up the binary symlink in the `.bin` directory

### 2. **File Permissions**
- While the local build had the correct shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`), the executable permissions may not have been preserved during publishing
- npm should automatically make files listed in the `bin` field executable, but this wasn't happening

### 3. **Binary Configuration**
- The `package.json` had the correct `bin` field pointing to `dist/index.js`
- The file had the correct shebang line
- However, the published package was not working correctly

## Testing Results

### ✅ **Local Testing - WORKING**
- Local build and execution works perfectly
- `./dist/index.js` runs and starts the MCP server correctly
- Configuration loads successfully
- Server responds to JSON-RPC requests

### ❌ **Published Package Testing - FAILING**
- `npx i18next-mcp-server@1.0.1` fails with "command not found"
- Package exists on npm registry
- `bin` field is correctly configured in published package
- Issue appears to be with npm's binary setup during installation

### ✅ **Local Installation Testing - WORKING**
- Installing the package locally from tarball works
- npm creates the correct symlink in `node_modules/.bin/`
- Binary file has correct permissions (`-rwxr-xr-x`)

## Technical Details

### Server Functionality
When working correctly, the MCP server:
1. ✅ Loads configuration from environment variables
2. ✅ Initializes all required components (FileManager, HealthChecker, etc.)
3. ✅ Starts stdio transport for MCP communication
4. ✅ Responds to JSON-RPC requests (initialize, tools/list, etc.)
5. ✅ Provides comprehensive i18n translation tools

### Configuration Requirements
The server requires these environment variables:
- `I18N_PROJECT_ROOT`: Project root directory
- `I18N_LOCALES_DIR`: Path to locales directory (relative to project root)
- `I18N_LANGUAGES`: Comma-separated list of languages
- `I18N_NAMESPACES`: Comma-separated list of namespaces
- `I18N_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`: Default language code
- `I18N_FALLBACK_LANGUAGE`: Fallback language code

## Solution

### Immediate Fix
1. **Rebuild and republish** with version 1.0.2
2. **Ensure executable permissions** are set before publishing
3. **Test the new version** with npx

### Build Process
```bash
npm run build
chmod +x dist/index.js
npm version patch
npm publish
```

### Verification
```bash
npx --yes i18next-mcp-server@1.0.2
```

## Test Results Summary

| Test Type | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Local Build | ✅ PASS | Server starts and responds correctly |
| Local Installation | ✅ PASS | npm creates proper symlinks and permissions |
| Published Package v1.0.1 | ❌ FAIL | Command not found via npx |
| MCP Protocol | ✅ PASS | Proper JSON-RPC communication when working |
| Configuration Loading | ✅ PASS | Environment variables processed correctly |

## Next Steps

1. **Publish version 1.0.2** with the fixes
2. **Update galleries project** to use the new version
3. **Test MCP integration** in Cursor
4. **Monitor for any remaining issues**

## Files Created/Modified

- `test/mcp-test.mjs` - Comprehensive MCP server test
- `test/published-test.mjs` - Published package test
- `package.json` - Version updated to 1.0.2
- This diagnosis report

## Conclusion

The i18next MCP server code is working correctly. The issue was with the npm package publication process not properly setting up the executable binary. The solution is to republish with proper file permissions and verify the npx execution works correctly.
