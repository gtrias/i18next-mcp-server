This test has been successfully implemented and has helped verify that the server works correctly with the MCP protocol.\n\nThe test implementation includes:\n\n1. A mock Cursor client that simulates the MCP protocol interactions\n2. End-to-end tests that verify the complete workflow:\n   - Initializing connection with the server\n   - Listing available tools (all 14 tools are properly exposed)\n   - Calling health check\n   - Getting project info\n   - Validating files\n\nAdditionally, a `debug-cursor.js` script has been created to help users troubleshoot their Cursor MCP configuration issues.\n\nThe testing revealed that the \"No server info found\" error some users experienced was due to Cursor MCP configuration issues, not server problems. The key requirements for proper configuration are:\n\n- I18N_PROJECT_ROOT must be an absolute path\n- Proper environment variables must be set up\n- Cursor needs to be restarted after config changes\n- MCP version must be set to 1.0.3 (not 1.0.2) in the mcp.json file\n\nA comprehensive `CURSOR_SETUP.md` guide has been created with step-by-step configuration instructions and example configurations for Next.js/React projects. The guide should be updated to emphasize the importance of using the correct MCP version (1.0.3).\n\nMajor improvements have been implemented to follow TypeScript MCP best practices, including:\n- Zod schema validation for all tools in a dedicated schemas.ts file\n- Proper error handling using `isError: true` format\n- Recommended main() function structure for server initialization\n- Proper async handling with `await server.connect(transport)`\n- Executable permissions via `chmod +x dist/index.js` in the build script\n- Type safety with Zod-inferred types instead of `unknown`\n- Consistent error responses following MCP standards\n\nA binary installation issue has been identified: while the MCP server works correctly when run directly (node dist/index.js), there's an issue with the npm binary installation when using npx. The binary is not being found by the system despite proper bin configuration in package.json. Until this is resolved, users should use the direct node command approach instead of npx.\n\nCompleted improvements include:\n- Comprehensive CLI interface with --help, --version, --test flags\n- Proper help documentation showing Cursor integration steps\n- Test mode to verify configuration without starting MCP server\n- All MCP best practices implemented (Zod validation, error handling, async connection)\n- Server functionality verified working correctly",

This test successfully caught integration issues that users might experience and confirmed that the server implementation is working correctly with the MCP protocol. The test should also verify compatibility with different MCP versions, particularly ensuring proper functionality with version 1.0.3.\n\nWith the recent implementation of MCP best practices, the tests should be expanded to verify:\n1. Proper Zod schema validation for all tool inputs\n2. Consistent error handling using the `isError: true` format\n3. Proper async server connection\n4. Type safety throughout the codebase\n5. Executable permissions for the built package\n\nAdditional testing is needed to address the npm binary installation issue. Tests should verify that the binary can be properly executed when installed globally or via npx. The test strategy should also include verification of the CLI interface functionality, including the --help, --version, and --test flags.",
