# Simplified Testing Strategy for i18next-mcp-server

## Problem Statement
Users are experiencing errors when trying to use the i18next-mcp-server from Cursor. We need basic testing to ensure reliability.

## Simple Goals
1. **MCP Integration Tests**: Ensure the server works correctly with MCP clients like Cursor
2. **Core Functionality Tests**: Test the main features that users actually use
3. **Error Handling**: Make sure errors are handled gracefully

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Essential Tests Only
1. **MCP Protocol Tests**: 
   - Server starts correctly
   - Responds to basic MCP requests (initialize, list tools, call tools)
   - Returns proper error messages

2. **Core Tool Tests**:
   - `get_project_info` - most basic functionality
   - `health_check` - main feature users need
   - `validate_files` - common use case

3. **Basic Error Scenarios**:
   - Invalid configuration
   - Missing files
   - Malformed requests

### Implementation Approach
- **Single test directory**: `tests/` (no complex structure)
- **One config file**: `vitest.config.ts`
- **Focus on integration**: Test the server as users would use it
- **Minimal mocking**: Only mock what's absolutely necessary

### Success Criteria
- Server starts without errors
- Basic MCP tools work correctly
- Users can integrate with Cursor successfully
- Test suite runs in under 30 seconds

## What We're NOT Doing
- Complex unit tests for every module
- Multiple test configurations
- Extensive mocking systems
- Performance testing
- Complex CI/CD integration

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tests pass consistently
2. Coverage of main user workflows
3. Easy to run and understand
4. Catches the integration issues users are experiencing
